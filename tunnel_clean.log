INF Thank you for 
trying Cloudflare 
Tunnel. Doing so, 
without a Cloudflare 
account, is a quick 
way to experiment and 
try it out. However, 
be aware that these 
account-less Tunnels 
have no uptime 
guarantee, are 
subject to the 
Cloudflare Online 
Services Terms of Use 
(https://www.cloudflar
e.com/website-terms/),
 and Cloudflare 
reserves the right to 
investigate your use 
of Tunnels for 
violations of such 
terms. If you intend 
to use Tunnels in 
production you should 
use a pre-created 
named tunnel by 
following: https://dev
